Openbox Config Files
for restart and shutdown to work, edit /etc/sudoers to include the following entry at the end:

ALL ALL=NOPASSWD:/sbin/shutdown

You should also install *feh* and place your favourite wallpaper image at ~/.config/openbox/image.jpg

dark.jpg is my preferred desktop background. It displays keyboard shortcuts and mouse tricks. I copied this somewhere and I could not remember where. If the owner wants me to remove this image, please send me an email and I will happily take it down. Or better yet, I could place the name of the owner as the original source. It is a very nice background, thank you very much for sharing!
